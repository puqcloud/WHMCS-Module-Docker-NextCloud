In the client area, customers have the ability to manage access to their **NextCloud** instance by defining a list of allowed IP addresses. This is configured in the **Restrict by IP** section of the service panel.

Only the IP addresses listed in this section will be allowed to connect to the NextCloud container. All other connections will be blocked for enhanced security.

**Note:** If no IP addresses are added, the system will allow access from <u>any</u> IP address by default.
